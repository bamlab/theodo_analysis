## 🧑‍💻 Usage

To use the lints, add as a dev dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dart pub add dev:theodo_analysis
# or
flutter pub add dev:theodo_analysis
```

Then, add an include in `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
include: package:theodo_analysis/analysis_options.yaml
```
**Optional**: enable DCM.
This packages also include a subset of [dcm](https://dcm.dev) rules. Since dcm needs an API key to start. You can skip this part. Also, we consider it as a great tool, and we recommend it's usage.

First instal dcm:
```bash
$ brew tap CQLabs/dcm
$ brew install dcm
```
Then, [activate the license](https://dcm.dev/docs/getting-started/#activating-the-license):
```bash
dcm activate --license-key=YOUR_KEY
```

## ⚙️ Customize rules
